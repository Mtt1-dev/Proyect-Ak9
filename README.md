# Project AK-9

## Overview
**Project AK-9** is an educational robotics project developed for **FIRST LEGO League (FLL)**.  
The rover’s main objective is to **document archaeological environments while prioritizing the safety of archaeologists**, allowing hazardous areas to be inspected remotely before human access.

The project emphasizes **social responsibility, safety-first design, and STEM education**, demonstrating how robotics can support humanitarian and scientific missions.

## Objectives
- Improve archaeologist safety through remote exploration
- Capture visual documentation of archaeological sites
- Minimize human exposure to unstable or dangerous environments
- Promote ethical and safety-focused engineering

## Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi Pico W  
- ArduCam camera module  
- 4 × DC motors  
- 2 × servo motors  
- 2 × acrylic bases (chassis)  
- Motor drivers  
- Battery power system  

## Core Features
- Remote-controlled rover navigation
- Live visual inspection via camera
- Servo-controlled camera positioning
- Modular and lightweight structure
- Wireless communication using Pico W
